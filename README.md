# Recipes

This project aims to demonstrate my understanding of HTML structure and linking multiple web pages.

## Skills Demonstrated

In this project, I have demonstrated the following skills:

- Creating HTML files and organizing them in directories.
- Adding headings, paragraphs, and lists to structure content.
- Linking pages together using anchor tags.
- Setting up a repository on GitHub.
- Using Git for version control.

## Iteration 1: Initial Structure

- Created an `index.html` file with boilerplate HTML and added an h1 heading "Recipes".

## Iteration 2: Recipe Page

- Created a `recipes` directory.
- Added a recipe page `italian_chicken_marinade.html` with an h1 heading containing the recipe name.
- Linked the recipe page from the `index.html` using an anchor tag.

## Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

- Added an image of the finished dish to the `italian_chicken_marinade.html` page.
- Added a "Description" heading and a paragraph describing the recipe.
- Added an "Ingredients" heading and an unordered list of ingredients.
- Added a "Steps" heading and an ordered list of steps for making the dish.

## Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

- Added `turkisk_chicken_kebabs.html` and `charbroiled_salmon.html` with identical structures.
- Linked the new recipe pages on the `index.html` page using an unordered list.

## Usage

To view the recipes, open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Click on the recipe links to navigate to the individual recipe pages.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- Git
- GitHub

## Future Enhancements

- Improve the styling and layout of the recipe pages using CSS.
- Add more recipes with unique content and images.
- Implement a search functionality to allow users to search for specific recipes.

## Self-Reflection

During the course of this project, I have learned the basics of structuring web pages using HTML, creating links between pages, and organizing content. Additionally, I have gained experience in setting up repositories on GitHub and using Git for version control. I faced challenges in ensuring proper commit messages and maintaining a consistent workflow. This project has helped me solidify my understanding of HTML elements, linking web pages, and utilizing Git and GitHub effectively. I plan to continue building upon this foundation and explore further web development concepts and technologies.
