    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lbs (680g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the boneless, skinless chicken breasts into 1-inch cubes, ensuring they are clean and trimmed of excess fat.</li>
        <li>a bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, ground cumin, ground paprika, ground coriander, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to form a marinade.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken cubes in the marinade, ensuring they are evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the chicken and marinade into a resealable bag. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or ideally overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill or oven to a high broil setting.</li>
        <li>If using skewers, thread the marinated chicken cubes onto the skewers, leaving a small gap between each piece for even cooking. Alternatively, you can cook the chicken directly on the grill or in a grill pan.</li>
        <li>Grill or broil the kebabs for about 6-8 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has a lightly charred exterior. Check for doneness by cutting into a piece to ensure it's no longer pink in the center.</li>
        <li>Transfer the Turkish Chicken Kebabs to a serving platter and garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve the kebabs as a main dish with rice pilaf, grilled vegetables, or a fresh salad.</li>
        <li>Optional: Add a dollop of tzatziki or squeeze some lemon juice over the kebabs for added flavor.</li>
        <li>Gather your loved ones, and enjoy the delicious taste of Turkey with these irresistible Turkish Chicken Kebabs.</li>
