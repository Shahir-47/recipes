        <li>1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li> 
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs (optional, such as basil, rosemary, or parsley) for additional flavor</li>
        <li>Chicken pieces (such as boneless, skinless chicken breasts or chicken thighs)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the extra-virgin olive oil, freshly squeezed lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried basil, dried thyme, crushed red pepper flakes (optional), salt, and black pepper. If desired, add fresh herbs like chopped basil, rosemary, or parsley for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Trim any excess fat from the chicken pieces and ensure they are clean and pat-dried.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish, spreading them out evenly.</li>
        <li>Pour the marinade over the chicken, making sure to coat each piece thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Seal the bag or cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 2 hours, or for best results, marinate overnight.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat your grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing any excess marinade to drip off. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Grill the chicken for approximately 6-8 minutes per side, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) using a meat thermometer.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a platter and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve the Italian marinated chicken with your choice of side dishes such as roasted vegetables, pasta salad, or a fresh green salad.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the succulent flavors of Italy with every bite!</li>
